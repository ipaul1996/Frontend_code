/*

null is a special value that represents "empty", "nothing", "value unknown".

If a variable is declared but it is not assigned with any value then we say its value is undefined.


Mutability refers to changing the value itself in the memory not the value of the variable.

Wherever JS code is used there is a JS engine(which itself is a program) that helps computer to 
understand the code.

JS code ---> JS Engine ---> Machine code
