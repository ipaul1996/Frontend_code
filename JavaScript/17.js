//Assignment Operator(=)
//An assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.

let a = 20;
let b = a;

//a = b	    a = b	    Assigns the value of b to a.
//a += b	a = a + b	Assigns the result of a plus b to a.
//a -= b	a = a - b	Assigns the result of a minus b to a.
//a *= b	a = a * b	Assigns the result of a times b to a.
//a /= b	a = a / b	Assigns the result of a divided by b to a.
//a %= b	a = a % b	Assigns the result of a modulo b to a.
//a**=b     a = a ** b  Assigns the result of a to the power b to a.
//a &= b	a = a & b	Assigns the result of a AND b to a.
//a |= b	a = a | b	Assigns the result of a OR b to a.
//a ^= b	a = a ^ b	Assigns the result of a XOR b to a.
//a <<= b	a = a << b	Assigns the result of a shifted left by b to a.
//a >>= b	a = a >> b	Assigns the result of a shifted right (sign preserved) by b to a.
//a >>>= b	a = a >>> b	Assigns the result of a shifted right by b to a.
